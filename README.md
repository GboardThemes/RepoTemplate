# RepoTemplate

just put your theme-packs in the `packs` folder

for infos like `author, tags, name` you can add `pack.meta` to your packs

example:
```
name: Some themes
author: Some author
tags:Tag1,Tag2,Tag3
```

in rboard manager v3 you can add the raw `list.json` as repo (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GboardThemes/RepoTemplate/main/list.json`)
